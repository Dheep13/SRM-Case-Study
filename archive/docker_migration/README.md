# Archived Files - Docker Migration

This directory contains files that are no longer needed after migrating to Docker deployment.

## Structure

- `cloud_foundry/` - Cloud Foundry deployment files (manifest.yml, Procfile, etc.)
- `old_docs/` - Old documentation and summary files
- `old_scripts/` - Old deployment and setup scripts
- `test_files/` - Test and diagnostic scripts
- `frontend_cf/` - Frontend Cloud Foundry deployment files

## Note

These files are kept for reference but are not needed for Docker deployment.
All Docker-related files are in the root directory.
