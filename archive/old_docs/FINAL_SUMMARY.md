# Project Complete: GenAI Learning Resources + Agentic RAG Chatbot

## What We Built

A complete AI-powered system for IT students to discover skills, find resources, and get personalized career advice using **Agentic RAG** (not just simple chunk retrieval).

## System Components

### 1. Data Discovery (GenAI Agents)
```
agents/
├── content_scraper_agent.py    # Finds learning resources
├── trend_analysis_agent.py      # Tracks GitHub/LinkedIn trends
└── orchestrator.py              # Coordinates both agents
```

**What it does:** Automatically discovers GenAI learning content and trending topics

### 2. Database Storage (Supabase + pgvector)
```
db_integration/
├── schema.sql                   # Main database schema
├── vector_embeddings.sql        # Vector search setup
├── supabase_client.py          # Database operations
├── skill_extractor.py          # AI skill extraction
├── data_loader.py              # ETL pipeline
└── embedding_manager.py        # Vector embeddings
```

**What it does:** Stores data with vector embeddings for semantic search

### 3. Trend Analysis
```
db_integration/
├── trend_analyzer.py           # Skill trend analysis
└── visualizer.py               # Chart generation
```

**What it does:** Analyzes skill demand, creates charts, generates learning roadmaps

### 4. **Agentic RAG Chatbot** (The Smart Part!)
```
db_integration/
├── agentic_rag.py             # Multi-step reasoning system
├── chatbot.py                 # Simple chatbot
```

**What it does:** Uses LLM to understand, plan, reason, draft, refine, and verify responses

## Agentic RAG Workflow

```
User Question
    ↓
1. 🧠 ANALYZE - LLM understands intent
    ↓
2. 📋 PLAN - LLM plans search strategy
    ↓
3. 🔍 RETRIEVE - Semantic search with vector embeddings
    ↓
4. 💭 REASON - LLM analyzes and connects data
    ↓
5. ✍️  DRAFT - LLM creates initial response
    ↓
6. ✨ REFINE - LLM improves clarity and accuracy
    ↓
7. ✓  VERIFY - Quality check
    ↓
Final Response
```

## Why Agentic RAG?

### ❌ Traditional RAG (What we DON'T do)
```python
# Simple approach
chunks = vector_search(query)
response = llm.generate(f"Context: {chunks}\nQuestion: {query}")
```
**Problem:** Just stuffs chunks into prompt, no reasoning

### ✅ Agentic RAG (What we DO)
```python
# Intelligent approach
analysis = llm.analyze_intent(query)
search_plan = llm.plan_searches(analysis)
data = multi_source_retrieve(search_plan)
reasoning = llm.connect_information(data)
draft = llm.create_response(reasoning)
refined = llm.improve_response(draft)
verified = llm.check_quality(refined)
```
**Benefit:** Multi-step reasoning, self-improvement, higher quality

## Key Features

### 🎯 Intent Understanding
Not just keywords - understands what you're actually asking

### 🔍 Semantic Search
Finds related concepts (e.g., "ML" finds "neural networks", "TensorFlow", etc.)

### 💡 Multi-Step Reasoning
